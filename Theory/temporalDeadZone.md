## Temporal Desd Zone (TDZ)

The TDZ is a behavior that occurs with variables declared using let and const. It represents the time between the entering of the block scope and the point where the variable is declared and initialized.

Key Characteristics of the TDZ:

- **Start of TDZ:** The TDZ starts at the beginning of the scope (e.g., the beginning of a block { ... }).
- **End of TDZ:** The TDZ ends when the variable is declared with let or const.
- **Accessing Variables in TDZ:** Any attempt to access a variable within its TDZ will throw a ReferenceError.
- **Purpose:** The TDZ helps prevent errors that might occur due to accessing variables before they are properly initialized, ensuring that variables are not used in an undefined state.
