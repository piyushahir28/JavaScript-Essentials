## String:

JavaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values (UTF-16 code units). Each element in the String occupies a position in the String. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements in it. You can create strings using string literals or string objects.

### String Literals:

You can create simple strings using either single or double quotes:

### String Objects:

The String object is a wrapper around the string primitive data type.

### Methods of Strings:

- **charAt():** The charAt() method of String values returns a new string consisting of the single UTF-16 code unit at the given index.

```javascript
const sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

const index = 4;

console.log(`The character at index ${index} is ${sentence.charAt(index)}`);
// Expected output: "The character at index 4 is q"
```

- **indexOf():** The indexOf() method of String values searches this string and returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring. It takes an optional starting position and returns the first occurrence of the specified substring at an index greater than or equal to the specified number.

```javascript
const paragraph = "I think Ruth's dog is cuter than your dog!";

const searchTerm = "dog";
const indexOfFirst = paragraph.indexOf(searchTerm);

console.log(`The index of the first "${searchTerm}" is ${indexOfFirst}`);
// Expected output: "The index of the first "dog" is 15"

console.log(
  `The index of the second "${searchTerm}" is ${paragraph.indexOf(
    searchTerm,
    indexOfFirst + 1
  )}`
);
// Expected output: "The index of the second "dog" is 38"
```
