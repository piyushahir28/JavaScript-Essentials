## JavaScript Versions

- ECMAScript 1 (ES1) (1997): The first standardized version of JavaScript, based on the language's original implementation by Netscape. It laid the foundation for subsequent versions of the language.

- ECMAScript 2 (ES2) (1998): A minor update that introduced features like try...catch exception handling and new methods for string manipulation.

- ECMAScript 3 (ES3) (1999): A significant update that added features like regular expressions, exception handling with try...catch...finally, and more robust object handling.

- ECMAScript 4 (ES4) (Abandoned): A proposed major update to JavaScript that aimed to introduce significant changes, including classes, modules, and optional type annotations. However, the complexity of the proposed changes led to disagreements within the JavaScript community, and the project was eventually abandoned in favor of smaller, incremental updates.

- ECMAScript 5 (ES5) (2009): A significant update that introduced new features like strict mode, which enforces stricter parsing and error handling rules, and added several new methods to built-in objects like arrays and functions.

- ECMAScript 6 (ES6) / ECMAScript 2015 (2015): A major update that introduced many new features and syntactic enhancements to the language, including arrow functions, classes, modules, template literals, destructuring assignment, and more. ES6 marked a significant milestone in the evolution of JavaScript and is widely supported by modern browsers.

- ECMAScript 2016 (ES7): A relatively minor update that introduced features like the includes() method for arrays and the exponentiation operator (\*\*).

- ECMAScript 2017 (ES8): Another incremental update that introduced features like async functions, shared memory and atomics (for low-level memory manipulation), Object.entries(), Object.values(), String padding, and more.

- ECMAScript 2018 (ES9): This update introduced features like asynchronous iteration, Promise.finally(), rest/spread properties for objects, RegExp improvements, and more.

- ECMAScript 2019 (ES10): Introduced features like Array.flat() and Array.flatMap() for flattening and mapping arrays, Object.fromEntries() for transforming a list of key-value pairs into an object, String.trimStart() and String.trimEnd() for trimming whitespace from the beginning and end of strings, and more.

- ECMAScript 2020 (ES11): Introduced features like nullish coalescing operator (??), optional chaining operator (?.), BigInt data type for arbitrary precision integers, globalThis object, String.matchAll() method, and more.

- ECMAScript 2021 (ES12): Introduced features like String.replaceAll() method, Promise.any() method for resolving the first promise to be fulfilled, Logical Assignment Operators (||=, &&=, ??=), and more.
